	<h3>About Memory Game</h3>

	<p class="description">It took a while to develop this game and it was based on bringing people together. Back in Dave's college days, he needed a way to get his different friend groups engaged with each other. Thus, Memory Game was born! It's fun because it challeges players to think and it makes for a friendly competition.</p>
